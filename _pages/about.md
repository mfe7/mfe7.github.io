I'm currently a **Visiting Faculty Researcher with Google's [People + AI Research (PAIR)](https://research.google/teams/brain/pair/)** team.
Then, I'll be joining **Northeastern University in January 2023** as an Assistant Professor, with a joint appointment in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and the Khoury College of Computer Sciences.

<span style="color:blue">**Prospective Ph.D. Students:**</span> I plan to admit multiple fully funded Ph.D. students to my group at Northeastern University in the 2022-2023 cycle. Please reach out via email if you are interested in applying!

My research lies at the intersection of robotics, deep learning, and control theory, with the goal of developing **certifiable learning machines**.
This means creating robots that discover how to do cool behaviors -- with guarantees on safety, reliability, and efficiency.
Some specific techniques of interest are: reinforcement learning (RL), reachability analysis, learning cost-to-go functions,  bridging semantic perception and motion planning, and model predictive control (MPC).
A key application area of interest is **navigation in challenging environments**, such as off-road (e.g., forests, deserts) and alongside humans (e.g., on busy sidewalks, in crowded buildings).

Previously, I was a Research Scientist and Postdoctoral Associate at the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, working on the [DARPA RACER](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2022-01-13) program, the [ARL SARA](https://www.arl.army.mil/business/collaborative-alliances/current-cras/sara-cra/sara-overview/) program, and advancing the field of certifiable learning.
I received the PhD (2020), SM (2017), and SB (2015) degrees from MIT in Mechanical Engineering.
