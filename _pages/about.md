I am a Research Scientist at the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, collaborating with [Prof. Jonathan How](http://www.mit.edu/~jhow/) and [Prof. Nicholas Roy](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/).
My research lies at the intersection of robotics, deep learning, and control theory.
I received the PhD (2020), SM (2017), and SB (2015) degrees from MIT in Mechanical Engineering.
My PhD work was advised by [Prof. Jonathan How](http://www.mit.edu/~jhow/), [Prof. John Leonard](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/john-leonard), and [Prof. Alberto Rodriguez](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/ALBERTOR@MIT.EDU).
